# Titanic Data Analysis Project

This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis exploration of the **Titanic dataset**.  
Using *Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib*, the project visualizes several important insights about the passengers, including:

- Class distribution  
- Age group distribution  
- Survival vs. death counts  
- Fare distribution  
- Gender-based survival  
- Survival rate by passenger class  

The goal of this project is to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills while interpreting real historical data.

## 📊 Visualizations Included

### 1. **Passenger Class Distribution**
A bar chart showing how many passengers belonged to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class.

### 2. **Age Group Distribution**
A pie chart separating passengers into:
- Kids (under 14)
- Teenagers (14–17)
- Adults (18–60)
- Elderly (60+)

### 3. **Survival vs. Death**
A bar chart showing total survivors vs. total deaths.

### 4. **Fare Distribution**
A histogram illustrating how passenger fares were distributed.

### 5. **Survivors by Gender**
Bar chart comparing male vs. female survival counts.

### 6. **Survival Rate by Class**
A bar chart showing the survival percentage for each passenger class.

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses the classic **Titanic dataset**, containing passenger features such as:

- `pclass`
- `survived`
- `sex`
- `age`
- `fare`
- and more.

!!! Make sure that the file `titanic.csv` is located in the same directory as the script.
